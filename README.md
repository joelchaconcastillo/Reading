#2016 Biased Multiobjective Optimization and Decomposition Algorithm by Hui Li Qingfu Zhang
###Comments: 
## "MOP problem features have been identified and studied [8], [19], [26]-[32]. Most of them are related to the geometric shapes of PF in the objective space [26]-[29] or the geometric shapes of Pareto set in the decision space [19], [30]. In [26]. [28] and [29], a class of MOPs with biases on its PS have been studied. Check these MOP's
##CMA-ES is good handlind interacting variables but it's high computational overheads. In addition, its performance is good with biased problems.
